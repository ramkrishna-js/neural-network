# Neural Network from Scratch 🧠

A modular implementation of a Neural Network built entirely with Python and NumPy. This project was developed as a college project to demonstrate the inner workings of deep learning algorithms including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

## Features
- Modular Layer system
- Activation functions (ReLU, Softmax)
- Cross-Entropy Loss
- Backpropagation from scratch
- MNIST Digit Recognition

## Installation
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd neural-network
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python train.py
```
